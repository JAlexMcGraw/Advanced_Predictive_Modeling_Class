# Advanced_Predictive_Modeling_Class
Repository for past class assignments. These files include different homework assignments where we used different ML algorithms, such as basic logistic and MLR algorithms, to more advanced ensemble methods like XGBoost, and a few neural networks. These homeworks also included the different implications behind the insights generated, along with other conceptual topics.
